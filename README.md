## What you can do with Neural Forge
Train and evaluate language models reproducibly at an accessible cost (~$20/experiment):
- Run baseline GPT-2 experiments with standardized evaluation
- Track and compare your results using Weights & Biases
- Validate your innovations against community benchmarks

## Quick Start
TODO

## Overview
The Neural Forge is a community-driven framework for reproducible language model research. We provide:
- A standardized evaluation environment
- Fixed dataset and model size constraints
- Automated experiment tracking
- Clear baseline benchmarks

## Core Principles
- **Reproducibility**: All experiments are tracked in Weights & Biases
- **Accessibility**: Cloud GPU training costs ~$20 per experiment
- **Simplicity**: Two key constraints:
  - Maximum 124M parameters active per token
  - Single pass through FineWeb EDU 10B tokens dataset

## Dataset
We use FineWeb EDU, a curated 10B token dataset of high-quality educational content created by Hugging Face.
Dataset into:
- TODO
Download: [TODO: Add download link]
Paper: [TODO: Add paper link]

Notes:
- Gradient accumulation is supported for limited memory setups
- Multi-GPU training uses PyTorch DDP
- Code for automatic micro batch size optimization is in utils.py [TODO: Implement optimal batch size finder]
- Training speed comparisons use throughput/FLOP metric [TODO: Implement throughput/FLOP measurement]

## Hyperparameter Sweeps
To ensure fair comparison and prevent excessive optimization:
- Maximum 20 sweep runs allowed per submission
- Each sweep run limited to 500M tokens
- All sweep configurations and results must be logged to Weights & Biases
- Final evaluation must use the complete 10B token dataset

## Evaluation
Models are evaluated on:
- HellaSwag (commonsense reasoning)
- [TODO: Additional benchmarks under consideration]

## Results
### Performance Overview
| Model | Date | Tokens/FLOP | Training Time | HSwag | Description |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------------|-------|-------------|
| Baseline GPT-2 | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] ± [TODO] | Original implementation |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Note: Results reported as mean ± std based on multiple runs (TODO: implement confidence intervals)
