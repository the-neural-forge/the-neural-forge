# The Neural Forge

## Getting Started

## Overview

The Neural Forge is a community-driven project for validating and reproducing language model research. By providing a standardized evaluation environment, we enable researchers and engineers to test their ideas against a GPT-2 baseline at an accessible cost (~$20 per experiment).

## Core Principles

- **Reproducibility**: All experiments are tracked in Weights & Biases for transparency
- **Accessibility**: Cloud GPU training costs around $20 per experiment
- **Simplicity**: Two main constraints:
  - Maximum 124M parameters active per token
  - Single pass through FineWeb EDU 10B tokens dataset

## Dataset

We use a fixed 10B token subset of FineWeb EDU, a high-quality educational content dataset created by Hugging Face.

Dataset statistics:
- Vocabulary size: [TODO: Add vocab size]
- Average sequence length: [TODO: Add avg seq length]
- Domain distribution: [TODO: Add domain distribution]
- Dataset hash: [TODO: Add SHA-256 hash]

Paper: [TODO: Add paper link]

## Hardware Requirements

- Minimum GPU memory: 8GB
- Supported configurations: 1-8 GPUs
- Gradient accumulation supported for different hardware setups

Example configurations:
- Single NVIDIA RTX 4090 (24GB)
- Single NVIDIA A100 (40GB/80GB)
- Multi-GPU setups (H100, A100, etc.)

## Hyperparameter Sweeps

To ensure fair comparison and prevent excessive optimization:
- Maximum 20 sweep runs allowed per submission
- Each sweep run limited to 500M tokens
- All sweep configurations and results must be logged to Weights & Biases
- Final evaluation must use the complete 10B token dataset

## Evaluation

Models are evaluated on:
- HellaSwag (commonsense reasoning)
- [TODO: Additional benchmarks under consideration]

## Results

### Performance Overview

| Model | Date | Hardware Config | Training Time | HSwag | Description |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------------|-------|-------------|
| Baseline GPT-2 | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] ± [TODO] | Original implementation |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Note: Results reported as mean ± std based on multiple runs (TODO: implement confidence intervals)
